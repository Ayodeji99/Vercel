<h1>Question 5</h1>
            <h2>Imagine a customer writes in requesting help with a 
                build issue on a framework or technology that you've
                 not seen before. How would you go about troubleshooting this 
                 and what questions would you ask the customer to understand 
                 the situation better?</h2>
                 <p>
                    When i am being faced with a build issue on a framework
                    or technology that i'm not farmiliar with, i use some key approach
                    that i use to troubleshoot the process systematically, i would be listing and 
                    explaining them in details
                 </p>

                    <h3>Request Detailed Error Information</h3>
                    <p>
                    Ask the customer to provide detailed information about the 
                    error message they are encountering. 
                    This includes the full error message, any stack traces,
                     and relevant logs. This information is crucial for identifying the root cause
                    </p>
                    <h3>Check Documentation and Resources</h3>
                    <p>
                    Start by researching the framework or technology documentation. 
                    Look for known issues, troubleshooting guides, and community forums. 
                    This can provide insights into common problems and their solutions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Review Configuration Files</h3>
                    <p>
                    Ask the customer to share relevant configuration files (e.g., package.json, 
                    build scripts, configuration files for the build tool). 
                    Review these files for any syntax errors, missing dependencies, or misconfigurations.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Check compatibility and Versions</h3>
                    <p>
                    Verify that the versions of the framework, dependencies, 
                    and tools are compatible. Incompatibilities between versions 
                    can often lead to build issues
                    </p>
                    <h3>Explore Environment and Dependencies</h3>
                    <p>
                    Inquire about the customer's development environment. 
                    Check if the required dependencies and tools are installed 
                    and configured correctly. Ensure that the environment matches 
                    the recommended setup for the framework.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Ask About Recent Changes</h3>
                    <p>
                    Find out if there have been any recent changes
                     to the codebase, dependencies, or the development environment.
                      This includes updates to packages, changes in configuration, 
                      or modifications to the build process.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Use Debugging Tools</h3>
                    <p>
                    If the problem persists,
                     encourage the customer to seek help from 
                     the community associated with the framework or technology. 
                     Forums, discussion groups, and online communities are 
                     valuable resources for getting assistance from experienced users.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Collaborate with Development Team</h3>
                    <p>
                    If the customer is part of a development team,
                     coordinate with their team members. 
                     They might have insights into recent changes,
                     ongoing development efforts, or specific aspects
                    of the codebase that could be relevant to the issue.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Document Findings and Solutions</h3>
                    <p>
                    Keep detailed records of the troubleshooting process,
                     including the steps taken, findings, and solutions.
                      This documentation can be useful for future reference and for sharing knowledge with the customer and the broader community.
                    </p>
                 </div>

            <p>
            Throughout the troubleshooting process, maintain effective communication with the customer.
             Regular updates on progress, additional information requests, 
             and collaboration help build trust and demonstrate commitment 
             to resolving the issue. Additionally, remain open to learning 
             from the customer's experience and insights, as they may offer 
             valuable perspectives on the problem.
