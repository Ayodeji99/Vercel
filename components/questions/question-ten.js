                    Hi Vercel,
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I hope this message finds you well. 
                    I recently took your test and wanted to share some constructive 
                    feedback that I believe could enhance the overall experience for 
                    participants.Firstly, I think providing a sample project or a set
                     of guidelines for the test would be immensely beneficial. 
                     Having a concrete example to work with not only helps participants
                      better understand the expectations but also allows them to showcase
                       their skills more effectively.  I have never use the Next.Js framework before, 
                       so i decided to buy a course on it, while i was studying the course, a new version was
                       released(next.js version 14), in which i was not sure if i should use
                       the old version or the new one, i have had a tight schedule over the month, 
                       because i like staying up to date on tech and trends, i decided to start 
                       learning the new framework and here i am, i'm able to complete this test. 
                       Additionally, it would be valuable 
                       if you could include reference materials or documentation by the company Vercel
                       i understand that some instructions were stated, but videos that
                        explain the framework, especially for new users would have been more appreciated. 
                        This could be in the form of links to official documentation 
                        or supplementary materials that provide insights into the 
                        technology, in this case, Next.js. This would create a more 
                        inclusive environment, ensuring that individuals who may be 
                        less familiar with the framework can still perform well on the test.
                         Lastly, consider setting a clear time frame for test submission.
                          This helps manage expectations for participants and ensures a 
                          consistent evaluation process. Providing a reasonable deadline 
                          encourages timely submissions and allows you to streamline the
                           assessment process. I believe these adjustments could contribute
                            to a more positive and effective testing experience. 
                            Thank you for considering my suggestions, 
                            and I appreciate the effort you put into refining your 
                            testing process.
